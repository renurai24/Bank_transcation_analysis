# Bank_transcation_analysis
Project Overview
The Bank Transaction Analysis project aims to analyze the behavior of bank customers through their transactions. It is designed to provide the bank with insights on customer spending habits, transaction types, fraud detection, and overall account health. This kind of analysis is critical for improving customer experience, managing risks, and making data-driven decisions.

Project Outcomes
Customer Insights: By calculating the total balance and transaction breakdown, the bank can better understand customer profiles and financial behaviors.

Transaction Analysis: Breaking down transaction types helps the bank to understand how customers use different financial products (e.g., frequent deposits vs. withdrawals).

Fraud Detection: Identifying flagged transactions helps mitigate risks and improves customer safety.

Spending Patterns: The average monthly spending analysis gives insights into how different customers manage their finances, which can help in offering personalized financial services.

Customer Value Identification: By identifying top customers by deposit volume, the bank can offer better services or benefits to retain these high-value customers.
